# Lets get started!
NOTE! This application can run only on Windows OS.

## 1. Prepare your system
- Need to create folder `XMLInput` in 
```
C:\Users\{Your_system_profile}\Documents
```
So, I've got next one:
```
C:\Users\Nikita\Documents\XMLInput
```

## 2. Download zip or clone repo
- After downloading/cloning repo follow to the next `assests`
and copy `test.xml` and paste it folder that we create in previous step.
If you want read another XML file remember about XML-schema that located in `assets` folder. XML file must be names strictly `test.xml`

## 3. Run
- Now you should just follow path `bin/windows/bin/application.exe` and run it.
